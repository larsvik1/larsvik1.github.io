<!--Body Paragraph-->
  <p>Quarentine has proven to be difficult when finding activities to do. I've been playing more piano<br> 
  and similar to Eric and Satveer, I have started playing new games such as <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Animal Crossing New Horizons.</em><br> 
  However above all, I have gotten most of my enjoyment from <em>Teamfight Tactics,</em> a strategy game by Riot Games<br> 
  (the same developers as <em>Valorant</em> and <em>League of Legends.</em>) This game doesn't require a good computer<br> 
  to play which means you are able to play on mobile wherever you want! Although this is a free game, it doesn't require<br> 
  the "pay to win" incentive unlike it's competitors.<br> 
  </p>

<!--Secondary Paragraph-->
  <div><strong>Teamfight Tactics</strong> is a strategy game by Riot games (same company who produces Valorant) <br>
    and contains a variety of items, champions, and team compositions. However, most of the game's content <br>
    is inspired by the companies other game <em>League of Legends</em>
