<!--Body Paragraph-->

  <p>Quarentine has proven to be difficult when finding activities to do. I've been playing more piano<br> 
  and similar to Eric and Satveer, I have started playing new games such as <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Animal Crossing:<br>
  New Horizons.</em> However above all, I have gotten most of my enjoyment from <em>Teamfight Tactics,</em> a strategy game<br> 
  by Riot Games (the same developers as <em>Valorant</em> and <em>League of Legends.</em>) This game doesn't require a good computer<br> 
  to play which means you are able to play on mobile wherever you want! Although this is a free game, it also doesn't<br> 
  have the "pay to win" incentive unlike it's competitors.<br>

    <strong>Resources I have used while learning</strong><br> 
      <span>  Since this game is based on strategy, it might seem daunting to play at first, however here are<br>
        some resources I have used to help my gameplay, as well as my overall understanding of the game
